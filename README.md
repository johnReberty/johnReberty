### Hi there! 😁

My name is Johnny Reberty from Brazil (🇧🇷). I have been working as a front-end developer since 2020. I am currently producing programs dedicated to education, to help municipalities in the interior of Rio Grande do Norte to go through this stage of the pandemic and to have good management in their schools in the future.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) Magic the gathering, to watch movies (🎞️) and to listen to music (🎵).
